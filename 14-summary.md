# Summary

The project underscored the cat-and-mouse dynamic inherent in cybersecurity engagements, highlighting both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) strategies. Through the incorporation of deception technologies, automated guardrails, and a purple team methodology, the honeypot-canary simulation successfully created a realistic, controlled, and cost-effective learning environment. Framing the project within the Charlie’s Angels theme not only injected creativity into the demonstration but also emphasized the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and intelligence principles vital to effective security operations and successful missions. 

The engagement showcased several notable wins. On the very first day of Red Team activity, the defenders were flooded with alerts, validating the effectiveness of the detection setup and proving the monitoring pipeline’s responsiveness. However, during the second day’s live demo, the system was not generating consistent pings as it had previously, revealing limitations in maintaining consistent visibility. Another success came from implementing IAM permissions, which provided role-based access controls and safeguarded sensitive components, though it required significant effort to balance security with usability across the team. Additionally, the team delivered a visually stunning and professional looking website, which elevated the realism of the simulation. 

The project also highlighted challenges and areas for improvement. Configuring IAM permissions proved cumbersome, and properly staging and concealing the canary tokens was more difficult than anticipated, occasionally reducing the impact of the deception layer. These experiences underscored the dual reality of cybersecurity projects: technical victories tempered by lessons learned from operational setbacks. Importantly, the Purple Team’s playbook captures these lessons in greater detail, documenting both the successes and failures alongside remediation steps. This ensures that future iterations of the project or similar engagements can build upon the foundation established here with stronger detection, improved deception placement, and more efficient role management.
