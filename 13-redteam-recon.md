# Red Team Recon

Recon was done using a Linux machine. First thing done was an nmap scan and a dig into the site. Which revealed the active IP addresses of the site and the current open port. Next a web extraction was done which revealed the Canary tokens however they were unreachable through the CLI. After purging through the website, using the Developerâ€™s tools. The canaries were found.
