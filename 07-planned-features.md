# Planned Features

To make the project more realistic and technically robust, two features were implemented: 

● Honey & Canary 

 A lightweight honeypot instance deployed inside an isolated /32 Security Group sends an alert on any attempted connection. In addition, canary tokens were scattered within the victim application container to expose attackers when accessed, serving as digital “tripwires” for the Gallery Guards. 

● Purple-Team Playbook 

 A series of concise, 1-page attack/detect/remediate playbooks were created for each MITRE ATT&CK technique demonstrated during the project. These playbooks documented how the Red Team attempted attacks and how the Blue Team detected and responded, reinforcing collaboration. Much like the Angels combining their unique skills to succeed in missions.
