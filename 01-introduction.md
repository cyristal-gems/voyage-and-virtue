# Introduction

The primary target of this engagement was a high-end art website developed by the Blue Team. This site not only acted as the victim system but also served as the testing ground for deception technologies, such as honeypots and canary tokens, designed to lure attackers and trigger alerts upon interaction. By combining offensive and defensive components in a single environment, the project created an opportunity to study the full lifecycle of cyberattacks, from intrusion attempts to detection, analysis, and remediation.
