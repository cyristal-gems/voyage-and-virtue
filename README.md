# Abstract

This document provides a detailed account of the phase 2 cybersecurity capstone project, designed to replicate real-world offensive and defensive engagements in a controlled cloud environment. The honeypot-canary was built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), chosen for its scalability, security features, and ability to model enterprise-grade infrastructure within an academic setting.

The exercise followed the Red Team vs. Blue Team methodology, which is widely used in cybersecurity training and operations. The Red Team functioned as the offensive group, attempting to compromise a simulated target environment by exploiting vulnerabilities, extracting sensitive information, and evading detection. In contrast, the Blue Team assumed a defensive role, responsible for architecting a secure environment, deploying monitoring tools, and responding to adversarial actions. To bridge these two perspectives, The project also incorporated Purple Team practices, which emphasize collaboration between attackers and defenders to improve overall organizational security posture.
